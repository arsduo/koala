v3.0.0 (2017-03-17)
======

Most users should not see any difference upgrading from 2.x to 3.0. Most of the changes are
internal to how requests go from a graph method (like `get_connections`) through the API to the
HTTP layer and back. If you're not using API#api or HTTPService.make_request directly, upgrading
should (in theory) require no code changes. (Let me know if you run into any issues.)

**Key breaking changes:**

* Koala now requires Ruby 2.1+ (or equivalent for JRuby, etc.)
* API#api now returns a Koala::HTTPService::Response object; graph_call handles further processing
* GraphBatchAPI no longer inherits from API (the interface is otherwise unchanged)
* Empty response bodies in batch API calls will raise a JSON::ParserError rather than returning nil
* HTTPService.make_request now requires an HTTPService::Request object (Koala.make_request does
  not)
* HTTPService behavior *should not* change, but in edge cases might. (If so, please let me know.)
* API#search now requires a "type"/:type argument, matching Facebook's behavior (improving their
  cryptic error message)

New features:

* Koala now supports global configuration for tokens, secrets, etc! See the readme.
* GraphCollection now exposes #headers, allowing access to etag/rate limiting/etc. info (thanks,
  pawandubey and jessieay!) (#589)

Updated features:

* Koala.config now uses a dedicated Koala::Configuration object
* TestUser#befriend will provide the appsecret_proof if a secret is set (thanks, kwasimensah!)
* API#search now requires an object type parameter to be included, matching Facebook's API (#575)
* RealtimeUpdates will now only fetch the app access token if necessary, avoiding unnecessary calls

Removed features:

* Removed support for the Rest API, since Facebook removed support for it (#568)
* Removed support for FQL, which Facebook removed on August 8, 2016 (#569)
* Removed legacy duplication of serveral constants in the Koala module (#569)
* Removed API#get_comments_for_urls, which pointed to a no-longer-extant endpoint(#570)

Internal improvements:

* Completely rewrote HTTPService.make_request and several others, extracting most logic into
  HTTPService::Request (#566)
* API#api now returns a Koala::HTTPService::Response object (#584)
* GraphBatchAPI no longer inherits from API (#580)
* GraphBatchAPI has been refactored to be simpler and more readable (thanks, acuppy!) (#551)
* Use the more secure JSON.parse instead of JSON.load (thanks, lautis!) (#567)
* Use JSON's quirks_mode option to remove hacky JSON hack (#573 -- thanks sakuro for the
  suggestion!)
* The gemspec now allows both JSON 1.8 and 2.0 (#596) (thanks, pawandubey!)
* Remove Autotest and Guard references (no longer used/needed)

Testing improvements:

* Fixed a bunch of failing mocked specs

Others:

* Added an issue and pull request template
* Updated Code of Conduct to 1.4

v2.5.0 (2017-02-17)
======

New features:

* API#get_object_metadata provides a convenient accessor to an object's graph metadata (thanks, sancopanco!)

Documentation improvements:

* Add explicit require to examples in readme.md (thanks, dwkns!)

Internal improvements:

* Remove MultiJson dependency (thanks, sakuro!)

v2.4.0 (2016-07-08)
======

**Note:** Koala is no longer officially supported on Ruby 1.9.3 (which was [end-of-lifed back in
2015](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/01/10/ruby-1-9-3-will-end-on-2015/)). Versions may
still work (until version 3.0, when we may start using keyword arguments), but will not be tested
on 1.9.3.

Updated features:

* Batch API requests will now properly calculate appsecret_proofs for multiple access tokens
  (thanks, mwpastore!)

Internal improvements:

* Koala now explicitly depends on MultiJson >= 1.3.0, since it uses methods introduced in that
  version

Testing improvements:

* Test Koala against Ruby 2.3.0 (thanks, thedrow!)


v2.3.0 (2016-04-10)
======

Updated features:

* API#get_user_picture_data is now API#get_picture_data. The old method and API#get_picture both
  remain with deprecation warnings. (Thanks noahsilas for earlier work on this!)
* Koala::Facebook::APIError now includes [debug and trace
  info](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/blob/master/lib/koala/errors.rb) provided by Facebook in the headers
  (thanks, @elhu!)

Internal Improvements:

* Graph API error handling is now done via the GraphErrorChecker class

Testing improvements:

* Upgraded RSpec to 3.3.0
* Removed pended specs that were no longer relevant
* Improved https regex in test suite (thanks, lucaskds!)

v2.2.0 (2015-08-11)
======

* Restore API#search, since Facebook still supports that for certain usecases (thanks, vhoof!)
* You can now specify format: :json in http_options to make Content-Type application/json requests (thanks, adparlor!)
* Koala now supports uploading videos by URL (thanks, filipegiusti!)
* GraphCollections now offer direct access to the collection summary data via #summary (thanks, vhoof!)

Internal Improvements:

* Use MultiJson::LoadError instead of the newer ParseError for backward compatibility (thanks, bunshin!)

Documentation improvements:

* modernize the hash syntax in the readme (thanks, st0012!)

v2.1.0
======

Documentation improvements:

* extend/clean up code quality badges (thanks, jbender!)

v2.0.0
======

Koala 2.0 is not a major refactor, but rather a set of small, mostly internal
refactors:

* BatchAPI now reads both access token and app secret from the original API
  instance (thanks, lukeasrodgers!)
* Remove legacy interfaces (deprecated since 1.2)
  * API#search (which Facebook doesn't support anymore)
  * TestUser#graph\_api and RealtimeUpdates#graph\_api (use #api instead)
  * Various HTTP options (see diff for deprecation warnings/upgrade
    instructions for each method)
  * NetHTTPService and TyphoeusHTTPService (see diff for deprecation
    warnings/upgrade instructions)
  * OAuth methods for dealing with session tokens (which Facebook stopped
    providing)
  * OAuth#get\_user\_from\_cookies (use get\_user\_info\_from\_cookies instead)
* Blocks passed to API#get_picture will work in the batch API (thanks, cwhetung!)
* Added API#get_user_picture_data to get data about a picture (thanks, morgoth!)

Other changes:

  the appsecret_proof parameters ([thanks,
  nchelluri!](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/pull/323))

Testing Improvements:
* Add 2.1.0 to travis.yml and update specs to pass w/o deprecation on RSpec 3.0
  ([thanks](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/pull/350),
  [petergoldstein](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/pull/348)!)
* With 1.9.0+ only support, removed the OrderedHash patch

Documentation Improvements:
* Make it clear that connections take a singlar form in API#put_connection
(thanks, [josephdburdick](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/pull/349)!)

v1.8.0
=========

NOTE: Due to updates to underlying gems, new versions of Koala no longer work
with Ruby 1.8.x, rbx/jruby in 1.8 mode, and Ruby 1.9.2. Earlier versions will,
of course, continue to work, since the underlying Facebook API remains the
same.

If you, tragically, find yourself stuck using these old versions, you may be
able to get Koala to work by adding proper constraints to your Gemfile. Good
luck.

New methods:
* OAuth#generate_client_code lets you get long-lived user tokens for client apps (thanks, binarygeek!)

Updated methods:
* GraphCollection#next_page and #previous_page can now take additional
  parameters ([thanks, gacha!](https://github.com/arsduo/koala/pull/330))

NOTE: the appsecret_proof update from nchelluri was originally listed in the
changelog for 1.8.0, but didn't make it in. It's now properly in the changelog
for 1.9.0.
