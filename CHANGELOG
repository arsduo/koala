v1.0
New methods:
-- Photo and file upload now supported through #put_picture
  -- Added UploadableIO class to manage file uploads
-- Added a delete_like method (thanks to waseem)
-- Added put_connection and delete_connection convenience methods
Updated methods:
-- Search can now search places, checkins, etc. (thanks, rickyc!)
-- You can now pass :beta => true in the http options to use Facebook's beta tier

-- All methods now accept an http_options hash as their optional last parameter (thanks, spiegela!)
-- url_for_oauth_code can now take a :display option (thanks, netbe!)
-- Net::HTTP can now accept :timeout and :proxy options (thanks, gilles!)
-- Test users now supports using test accounts across multiple apps
Internal improvements:
-- For public requests, Koala now uses http by default (instead of https) to improve speed
  -- This can be overridden through Koala.always_use_ssl= or by passing :use_ssl => true in the options hash for an api call
-- Read-only REST API requests now go through the faster api-read server
-- Replaced parse_signed_request with a version from Facebook that also supports the new signed params proposal
  -- Note: invalid requests will now raise exceptions rather than return nil, in keeping with other SDKs
-- Delete methods will now raise an error if there's no access token (like put_object and delete_like)
-- Updated parse_signed_request to match Facebook's current implementation (thanks, imajes!)
-- APIError is now < StandardError, not Exception
-- Added KoalaError for non-API errors
-- Net::HTTP's SSL verification is no longer disabled by default
Test improvements:
-- Incorporated joshk's awesome rewrite of the entire Koala test suite (thanks, joshk!)
-- Expanded HTTP service tests (added Typhoeus test suite and additional Net::HTTP test cases)
-- Live tests now verify that the access token has the necessary permissions before starting
-- Replaced the 50-person network test, which often took 15+ minutes to run live, with a 5-person test

v0.10.0
-- Added test user module
-- Fixed bug when raising APIError after Facebook fails to exchange session keys
-- Made access_token accessible via the readonly access_token property on all our API classes

v0.9.1
-- Tests are now compatible with Ruby 1.9.2
-- Added JSON to runtime dependencies
-- Removed examples directory (referenced from github instead)

v0.9.0
-- Added parse_signed_request to handle Facebook's new authentication scheme
  -- note: creates dependency on OpenSSL (OpenSSL::HMAC) for decryption
-- Added GraphCollection class to provide paging support for GraphAPI get_connections and search methods (thanks to jagthedrummer)
-- Added get_page method to easily fetch pages of results from GraphCollections
-- Exchanging sessions for tokens now works properly when provided invalid/expired session keys
-- You can now include a :typhoeus_options key in TyphoeusService#make_request's options hash to control the Typhoeus call (for example, to set :disable_ssl_peer_verification => true)
-- All paths provided to HTTP services start with leading / to improve compatibility with stubbing libraries
-- If Facebook returns nil for search or get_connections requests, Koala now returns nil rather than throwing an exception

v0.8.0
-- Breaking interface changes
  -- Removed string overloading for the methods, per 0.7.3, which caused Marshaling issues
  -- Removed ability to provide a string as the second argument to url_for_access_token, per 0.5.0

v0.7.4
-- Fixed bug with get_user_from_cookies

v0.7.3
-- Added support for picture sizes -- thanks thhermansen for the patch!
-- Adjusted the return values for several methods (get_access_token, get_app_access_token, get_token_from_session_key, get_tokens_from_session_keys, get_user_from_cookies)
  -- These methods now return strings, rather than hashes, which makes more sense
  -- The strings are overloaded with an [] method for backwards compatibility (Ruby is truly amazing)
    -- Using those methods triggers a deprecation warning
    -- This will be removed by 1.0
  -- There are new info methods (get_access_token_info, get_app_access_token_info, get_token_info_from_session_keys, and get_user_info_from_cookies) that natively return hashes, for when you want the expiration date
-- Responses with HTTP status 500+ now properly throw errors under Net::HTTP

-- Added OAuth Playground git submodule as an example
-- Updated tests, readme, and changelog

v0.7.1

array of results directly (rather than a hash with one key)

-- Added _greatly_ improved testing with result mocking, which is now the default set of tests
