v0.7.4 
-- Fixed bug with get_user_from_cookies

v0.7.3
-- Added support for picture sizes -- thanks thhermansen for the patch!
-- Adjusted the return values for several methods (get_access_token, get_app_access_token, get_token_from_session_key, get_tokens_from_session_keys, get_user_from_cookies)
  -- These methods now return strings, rather than hashes, which makes more sense
  -- The strings are overloaded with an [] method for backwards compatibility (Ruby is truly amazing)
    -- Using those methods triggers a deprecation warning
    -- This will be removed by 1.0
  -- There are new info methods (get_access_token_info, get_app_access_token_info, get_token_info_from_session_keys, and get_user_info_from_cookies) that natively return hashes, for when you want the expiration date
-- Responses with HTTP status 500+ now properly throw errors under Net::HTTP 
-- Updated changelog
-- Added license

v0.7.2
-- Added support for exchanging session keys for OAuth access tokens (get_token_from_session_key for single keys, get_tokens_from_session_keys for multiple)
-- Moved Koala files into a koala/ subdirectory to minimize risk of name collisions
-- Added OAuth Playground git submodule as an example 
-- Updated tests, readme, and changelog

v0.7.1
-- Updated RealtimeUpdates#list_subscriptions and GraphAPI#get_connections to now return an 
array of results directly (rather than a hash with one key)
-- Fixed a bug with Net::HTTP-based HTTP service in which the headers hash was improperly formatted
-- Updated readme

v0.7.0
-- Added RealtimeUpdates class, which can be used to manage subscriptions for user updates (see http://developers.facebook.com/docs/api/realtime)
-- Added picture method to graph API, which fetches an object's picture from the redirect headers.
-- Added _greatly_ improved testing with result mocking, which is now the default set of tests
-- Renamed live testing spec to koala_spec_without_mocks.rb
-- Added Koala::Response class, which encapsulates HTTP results since Facebook sometimes sends data in the status or headers
-- Much internal refactoring
-- Updated readme, changelog, etc.
